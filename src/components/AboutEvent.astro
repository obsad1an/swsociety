          Consent, communication, and mutual respect are the foundation of every
          interaction. There is no pressure to participate — you decide how you
          engage, at your own pace and within your own boundaries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open to adults of all genders and identities. Experience is not
          required. Curiosity, awareness, and respect are.
