      <p class="content-subtitle">The people behind the night.</p>

      <div class="content-body">
        <p>
          We are a small collective of organizers, creatives, and community
          members who share a passion for sex-positive spaces, conscious
          connection, and respectful exploration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our backgrounds come from nightlife, art, music, and community work.
          What connects us is a shared belief that kink and sexuality can be
          explored openly, safely, and without judgment — when consent and care
          come first.
        </p>

        <p>
          We created <strong>My Event</strong> to offer a space where curiosity is
          welcome, boundaries are respected, and diversity is celebrated. Every detail
          of the event is shaped with intention, from the atmosphere to the people
          we welcome at the door.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are present during the event, approachable, and attentive. Our role
          is to hold the space, support our guests, and ensure that everyone can
          feel safe, respected, and free to enjoy the night in their own way.
